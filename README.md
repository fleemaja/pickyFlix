# PickyFlix


PickyFlix is a universal iOS (iPad and iPhone) application for exploring movies.

To use PickyFlix you must have an account and an API key for [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en "TMDB homepage"). Instructions for getting an API key can be found [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api?language=en).

Once you have an API key, download this project, navigate to the root folder, and create a file in the '/pickyFlix/' folder called Keys.swift and add the following line to be able to use the app: ```let TMDBapiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY"```

PickyFlix allows you to explore the Movie Database's '/discover' API endpoint by choosing different sorting and filtering options for movies.

Movies can then be added to your persisted watchlist and accessed via the watchlist tab without a network connection. Watchlist items can be removed by swiping left on a watchlist movie cell or by unchecking a watchlist movie in the search results. A link to the Movie Database's web page on each movie is accessible by tapping on a movie's row.
